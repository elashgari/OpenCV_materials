# Scaling comes in handy in many image processing as well as machine learning applications. 
# It helps in reducing the number of pixels from an image and that has several advantages e.g. 
# It can reduce the time of training of a neural network as more is the number of pixels in an 
# image more is the number of input nodes that in turn increases the complexity of the model.
# It also helps in zooming in images. Many times we need to resize the image i.e. either shrink
#  it or scale up to meet the size requirements. OpenCV provides us several interpolation methods for resizing an image.
 

# Choice of Interpolation Method for Resizing â€“ 

# cv2.INTER_AREA: This is used when we need to shrink an image.
# cv2.INTER_CUBIC: This is slow but more efficient.
# cv2.INTER_LINEAR: This is primarily used when zooming is required. This is the default interpolation technique in OpenCV.
