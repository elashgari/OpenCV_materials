# Erosion: 
# It is useful for removing small white noises.
# Used to detach two connected objects etc.
# Dilation:
# In cases like noise removal, erosion is followed by dilation. Because, erosion removes white noises, but it also shrinks our object. So we dilate it. Since noise is gone, they wonâ€™t come back, but our object area increases.
# It is also useful in joining broken parts of an object.
